aCARdeRUN
=========

### Introduction
The aCARdeRUN project was developed as part of the event "game development for mobile devices" in the winter semester 2011/2012. The primary objective of the work was the development of a 3D game based on an own developed OpenGL ES 1.0 Framework and the Android platform 2.3 (API level 10).

### The Game
aCARdeRun is a game in which skill and speed of the users are demanded. 
The player sits in a racing car, traveling along a two-lane country road. In unpredictable moments the player is faced with the problem of unforeseeable arising obstacles on the road. It is now up to avoid an accident. At regular intervals, the racing car accelerates and the player has to avoid obstacles without crashing them. If an accident happened, the game is over and the elapsed time is recorded.
